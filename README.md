# ⚡CUDACyclone: GPU Satoshi Puzzle Solver

Cyclone CUDA is the GPU-powered version of the **Cyclone** project, designed to achieve extreme performance in solving Satoshi puzzles on modern NVIDIA GPUs.  
Leveraging **CUDA**, **warp-level parallelism**, and **batch EC operations**, Cyclone CUDA pushes the limits of cryptographic key search.

Secp256k1 math is based on the excellent work from [JeanLucPons/VanitySearch](https://github.com/JeanLucPons/VanitySearch), and [FixedPaul/VanitySearch-Bitcrack](https://github.com/FixedPaul) with major CUDA-specific modifications.  
Special thanks to Jean-Luc Pons for his foundational contributions to the cryptographic community.

Cyclone CUDA also is the **simplest CUDA-based project** for solving Satoshi puzzles on GPU.  
It was designed with clarity and minimalism in mind — making it easy to **compile, understand, and run**, even for those new to CUDA programming.  

Despite its simplicity, Cyclone CUDA leverages **massive GPU parallelism** to achieve extreme performance in elliptic curve computations and Hash160 pipelines. 

⚠️ **Achieved 6.5Gkeys/s on RTX4090. 8.6Gkeys/s on RTX5090.**  
⚠️ **Multi-GPU support: auto-detects all CUDA GPUs and runs one worker per GPU.**  
⚠️ **New `--random` mode: lottery search — each GPU jumps randomly across the full range.**
⚠️ **For preventing decresasing GPU speed you need to use --slices option and not to start brooteforce with 256 points per batch! THe best tune for 4090 is --grid 128,128 --slices 16**

## ⚠️ Problem with a key skipping was fixed!
My software was skipping keys earlier.  
I fixed this problem, to make sure that keys are not skipped I wrote a small script in python.   
The script is called **proof.py**. The script generates random scalars in a given range, calculates addresses, then runs Cyclone and at the end of the work shows how many keys were found and how many were not found. All should be found.
Usage
```
usage: proof.py [-h] --range RANGE_ARG [--cyclone-path CYCLONE_PATH] [--grid GRID_ARG] [--batch BATCH] [--timeout TIMEOUT] [--start-count START_COUNT] [--end-count END_COUNT] [--quartile-count QUARTILE_COUNT]
```
Sample start
```
python3 proof.py --range 200000000:3FFFFFFFF --grid 512,512
```

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multi-GPU**: Auto-detects all CUDA GPUs — spawns one worker thread per GPU with independent CUDA context.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Optimized for NVIDIA GPUs with full CUDA support.
- **Massive Parallelism**: Tens of thousands of threads computing elliptic curve points and **hash160** simultaneously.
- **Batch EC Operations**: Efficient group addition and modular inversion with warp-level optimizations.
- **Grid/Batch Control**: Fully configurable GPU execution with `--grid` parameter (threads per batch × points per batch).
- **`--random` mode**: Lottery search — each GPU independently jumps to random positions across the full range.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux and Windows.
- **Cross Architecture**: Automatic compilation for all detected GPU architectures (compiles cubin per device).
- **Extremely low VRAM usage**: Key feature! For low price rented GPU.
---

## 🚀 Options
- **`--range`**: range of search (hex, e.g. `2000000000:3FFFFFFFFF`).
- **`--address`**: P2PKH address to search for.
- **`--target-hash160`**: same as address but raw hash160 hex.
- **`--grid`**: thread config. Format `--grid <points_per_batch>,<threads_per_block>`. Example: `--grid 512,512`.
- **`--slices`**: batches per thread per kernel launch. Tune for GPU occupancy.
- **`--random`**: enable lottery/random-jump mode. Each GPU picks a random position before every kernel launch, covering the full range independently. Use with `--slices` to control chunk size.

## 🛠️ Setup & Build

### Linux
```bash
# Automatic setup — detects CUDA, installs dependencies, builds
git clone https://github.com/jmr2704/CUDACyclone.git
cd CUDACyclone
bash setup.sh
```

Or manually (if CUDA and build tools are already installed):
```bash
make
```

### Windows
```powershell
# Automatic setup — detects CUDA Toolkit, Visual Studio, make, builds
git clone https://github.com/jmr2704/CUDACyclone.git
cd CUDACyclone
.\setup.ps1
```

### How it works
- The **Makefile** automatically detects compute capabilities of **all installed GPUs** and generates optimized cubins for each architecture.
- **setup.sh** (Linux) installs CUDA Toolkit, build-essential and compiles.
- **setup.ps1** (Windows) detects CUDA Toolkit, Visual Studio, make and compiles.
- Both scripts detect the latest CUDA version available on your system.
- Running `make` directly also works — falls back to `86` if no GPU is detected.
- **Multi-GPU**: at runtime, all CUDA GPUs are auto-detected and a worker thread is spawned per GPU. Each thread manages its own CUDA context, streams, and memory. An atomic shared flag coordinates fast cross-GPU stop when a key is found.
- **`--random` mode**: instead of scanning linearly, each GPU independently picks a random position within the full range before every kernel launch. Use `--slices N` to tune chunk size vs. jump frequency.
## 🚧**Version**
**V1.3**: Full CUDA Kernel rewrite again for preventing key skipping.    
**V1.2**: Full CUDA Kernel rewrite.  
**V1.1**: Switch pGx/pGy to constant memory due to VRAM thermal throttling.  
**V1.0**: Release.
